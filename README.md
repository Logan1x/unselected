website : http://unselected.vercel.app/

## Inspiration

Cover letter adds brownie points to candidates profile, and when applying for multiple jobs, its very tediuos to write distinct cover letter for each profile. With this motivation, We made a website, which takes very short info about the position you are applying for and writes cover letter for you.

## What it does

Using OpenAI's GPT-3, it generates cover letter from given prompts.

## How I built it

We used NextJS for UI and TailwindCSS for styling.

## Challenges I ran into

- When we started we didn't have a designer in our team, so we made a webpage without thinking design and ran into very bad layout. Later with help of one of the member, we overcome that problem.
- When we were trying to intregate OpenAI package, we were facing cors issue. later with help of community, we were able to fix it.

## What we learned

- How to work in a team project.
- Working in different time zones.
- Work with machine learning models.

## What's next for Retricia

- Adding copy to clipboard and download button on results page.
- Dark mode.
- Optimize the response time.
- Taking user feedback and work on it.
